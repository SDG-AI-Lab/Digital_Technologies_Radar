# UNDP Radar Application

Code base seated on repo  [UNDP Radar](https://github.com/SDG-AI-Lab/Digital_Technologies_Radar).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

    <p><i>"Volunteering for me was something to do in the far future, when my life got more stable... and then Covid happened. That was a great opportunity to apply for a volunteering project. I was looking for a visualisation challenge, and that's how I picked up the 'Radar' project. The goal was to do a radar like visualisation and improve how data could be displayed and organised. It was an incredible challenge, where a new react lib was set up to create a generic radar like component that could be expanded. To create that lib we needed some state manipulation that could also be tapped from outside the lib, and a new simple react state manipulator library was also developed for the only purpose of the radar lib. We also had to learn how to generate a fairly homogeneous distribution of items over some bounded area, and for that, we implemented Poisson distribution straight from an academic paper.
In the end, with the help of many incredible volunteers from around the world, we were able to get into a very clean and final state that I am proud of and that I hear the users love. The whole team is very proud of what was achieved here and we hope to have positively impacted our wellbeing on this planet a little bit."</i></p>
