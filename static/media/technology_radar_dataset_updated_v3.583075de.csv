The last population census in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was carried out in 2002, leaving a major gap in population data. This gap can create serious problems during emergencies. For example, during a winter storm in 2012, rescue helicopters were dispatched to remote villages only to discover that nobody was there. Having real-time tools in place could help capture the population’s mobility and ensure that those most-at risk are reached on time. UNDP and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Crisis Management Center have recently completed integrated risk and hazard assessments in each of the 81 municipalities in the country. Using mobile data to complement all this work seemed the natural next step. The way people use mobile phones provides insights into patterns of behaviour on the ground that can be life-saving.

However, the disadvantage of cameras is that they struggle to detect people who are hidden in shadows. To solve this problem, we mounted an array microphone on a UAV and to detect the human voice as a means of finding people that cameras cannot. Also a search method is proposed that combines voice and camera human detection to compensate for their respective shortcomings. The rate and accuracy of human detection by the proposed method are assessed experimentally.",Disaster Risk Management ,Seach and rescue,prototype,response,Drones,Various,Global,None,None,Spatial Data,No Information,2020,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9104665

131,Solving referral challenges for urban poor to access Emergency Obstetric and New-born Care,"Women and adolescent childbearing girls living in the slums in Bangladesh lack financial and geographic access to an evidence-based, timely, referral process from the midwifery centre to a specific referral hospital when required for continued management of high risk pregnant women and obstetric emergencies. So, the referral platform will provide access to continued comprehensive emergency obstetric and new-born care services when needed at the referral hospital for women by reducing the delay in reaching the hospital and improving quality of care.  Using a structured process for communication between midwife to driver, and the referring midwife and the receiving health care provider- seamless referrals and continuity of care will be provided. The main users of our platform are the midwives working in the midwifery centres and the transport drivers, both in the urban slum areas of Dhaka in Bangladesh, as well as the receiving health care provider at the referral facility. However, the pregnant women are the main beneficiaries of this intervention.
