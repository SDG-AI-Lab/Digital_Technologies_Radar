# Onboarding

Welcome to our onboarding document.

## Design

We are currently using Framer to setup this project. Check the following [link](https://framer.com/projects/UN-Radar-on-mobile--qrJuCdhqJOZbXUjm6Yf7-czGqg) to view it. In order to get access please request it to [Nuno Ribeiro](nmpribeiro@gmail.com).

## Software development

Our project uses modern (as of 2021) [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

* We aim to use React in its Functional form, by leveraging `FunctionalComponents` and hooks

* Our project is tailored for UNDP AI Labs

* There is a library which is responsible for all Radar logic [here](https://github.com/SDG-AI-Lab/Digital_Technologies_Radar_Lib)
