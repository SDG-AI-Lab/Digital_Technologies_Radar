33,The SKAI isn’t the limit: How WFP uses satellite imagery and machine learning in emergencies.,"A lack of on-the-ground information at the start of a humanitarian crisis is a major obstacle to a quick, effective response. The WFP partnered with Google Research to set up the SKAI platform. Skai (formerly known as RUDA) uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and satellites to help WFP reduce the amount of time needed to understand the impact of disasters. By using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to analyze images provided by satellites, WFP can respond to emergencies without the delays and logistics obstacles associated with a traditional response. Skai dramatically speeds up the process of determining what has happened, what to expect on the ground, and help define the kind of support that is required.

38,PRISM: Using data to save lives when disasters strike,"When natural disasters strike, rescue services need to know where people are most at risk. The last population census in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was carried out in 2002, leaving a major gap in population data. This gap can create serious problems during emergencies. For example, during a winter storm in 2012, rescue helicopters were dispatched to remote villages only to discover that nobody was there. Having real-time tools in place could help capture the population’s mobility and ensure that those most-at risk are reached on time. UNDP and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Crisis Management Center have recently completed integrated risk and hazard assessments in each of the 81 municipalities in the country. Using mobile data to complement all this work seemed the natural next step. The way people use mobile phones provides insights into patterns of behaviour on the ground that can be life-saving. The team set out to study whether mobile phone calls could serve as proxy indicators for people’s mobility, as well as to understand how men and women use mobile phones differently (for clues into their diverse levels of vulnerability based on sex-disaggregated data).",EWS,Disaster relief logistic/resource allocation ,production,response,Mobile App,Various,Asia,Cambodia ,"WFP, Cambodia’s National Committee for Disaster Management",WFP Innovation Accelerator,Text Data,No Information,2018,https://medium.com/world-food-programme-insight/prism-using-data-to-save-lives-in-cambodia-9607ebde5e21,https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*tszoPbwOGexrjfwcWVMt4g.jpeg
