5,Applying Big Data for Identification of Positive Deviance,"Positive deviance is a growing approach in international development that identifies those within a population who are outperforming their peers in some way, eg, children in low‐income families who are well nourished when those around them are not. Analyzing and then disseminating the behaviors and other factors underpinning positive deviance are demonstrably effective in delivering development results. However, positive deviance faces a number of challenges that are restricting its diffusion. UNDP Accelerator Labs, GIZ Data Lab and UN Pulse Lab aims at experimenting and applying a positive deviance ""Data Powered Positive Deviance Initiative"" approach in selected Country Offices globally. The promise of “big data‐based positive deviance” is analyzing typical sources of big data in developing countries—mobile phone records, social media, remote sensing data, etc.—to identify both positive deviants and the factors underpinning their superior performance.
