Niger — Ensuring Food Security Through Sustainable Agriculture,"Sustained agriculture in Niger is under tremendous pressure.

On the other hand, climate change and the reduction of rainfall affect longer agricultural cycles, like that of sorgho which has an average cycle of six months. Crops are of lesser quality as they mature in a drier context, which in turn aggravates food insecurity.

The UNDP Niger Accelerator Lab and partners will use remote-sensing data to identify positively deviant cultivator communities that manage to accelerate their agricultural cycles, for instance by using soaking techniques, thereby shortening their land occupation and improving the quality of their crops.

Social media analysis and household data analysis to work towards SDG 16. ,"SDG 16, which calls for “peace, justice, and strong institutions,” is one of the most difficult to measure. Most countries do not have a baseline for the goals, as factors like corruption just don’t have strong indicator precedents. Tunisia is part of a group of pilot countries working to find ways to track and evaluate progress on SDG 16. Within this pioneering work, the Tunisia National Statistics Institute and the UNDP Tunisia office saw an opportunity for data innovation. Having completed the first household survey on governance and democracy, the team explored complementary data sources. Social media presented an exciting opportunity. While “corruption” may not be specifically quantifiable, public sentiment can be one indicator—and people are vocal on social media about their perceptions of corruption. The team researched whether public sentiment could be effectively measured by analyzing keywords in Twitter messages.

Using data to save lives in natural disasters,"When natural disasters strike, rescue services need to know where people are most at risk. The last population census in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was carried out in 2002, leaving a major gap in population data. This gap can create serious problems during emergencies. For example, during a winter storm in 2012, rescue helicopters were dispatched to remote villages only to discover that nobody was there. Having real-time tools in place could help capture the population’s mobility and ensure that those most-at risk are reached on time. UNDP and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Crisis Management Center have recently completed integrated risk and hazard assessments in each of the 81 municipalities in the country. Using mobile data to complement all this work seemed the natural next step. The way people use mobile phones provides insights into patterns of behaviour on the ground that can be life-saving. The team set out to study whether mobile phone calls could serve as proxy indicators for people’s mobility, as well as to understand how men and women use mobile phones differently (for clues into their diverse levels of vulnerability based on sex-disaggregated data).",Disaster Risk Management,resilience,Macedonia,Geographical Information Systems,Prototype,The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Crisis Management Center,UNDP Macedonia,Mobile Data,https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/development-impact/a-guide-to-data-innovation-for-development---from-idea-to-proof-.html,SDG 13,2011

This planning solution combines the scalability of a sophisticated planning application to the design sensibility and intuitive accessibility of its design interface.

At its core, this application uses sophisticated algorithms to analyse hi-resolution data on urban landscape and infrastructure (mostly available open source) to produce simulated scenarios of sustainable urban development and a new way of urban planning - one that is dynamics, iterative and comprehensive.

Using data to save lives in natural disasters,"When natural disasters strike, rescue services need to know where people are most at risk. The last population census in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was carried out in 2002, leaving a major gap in population data. This gap can create serious problems during emergencies. For example, during a winter storm in 2012, rescue helicopters were dispatched to remote villages only to discover that nobody was there. Having real-time tools in place could help capture the population’s mobility and ensure that those most-at risk are reached on time. UNDP and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Crisis Management Center have recently completed integrated risk and hazard assessments in each of the 81 municipalities in the country. Using mobile data to complement all this work seemed the natural next step. The way people use mobile phones provides insights into patterns of behaviour on the ground that can be life-saving.

"Macroscopic Traffic Flow Modelling, Road Speed Profiling, Traffic Congestion Nowcasting: Data for Sustainable Transport Systems","We were particularly interested in looking at the dynamics between regular days and special days (such as the Songkran Festival that takes place during the Thai New Year celebrations around mid-April). Therefore, analysing pseudonymised ride-hailing data covering the periods September-December 2018 and March-April 2019, we set out to find preliminary answers to the following questions:

How might ride-hailing data complement existing transport models, such as road speed profiling and traffic flow models?
To what extent can ride-hailing data provide real-time insights on traffic patterns?
Is there an opportunity to use ride-hailing data to shed light on possible exposure to air pollution?",Mobility,resilience,Thailand,Big Data,Prototype,GIZ Data Lab,UN Global Pulse,"Results of our speed profiling experiment indicated that ride-hailing data can also provide a high frequency proxy estimate of traffic conditions, and overall traffic speeds. Given that speed information is captured continuously, this data set allows transportation specialists to understand the day-to-day traffic and speed patterns for different scenarios, such as during weekday, weekend and special events. Subject to data access, doing so enables profiling for different types of activity that can each be updated in near-real time.",https://www.blog-datalab.com/home/data-for-sustainable-transport-in-bangkok-thailand/,SDG 11,2000
