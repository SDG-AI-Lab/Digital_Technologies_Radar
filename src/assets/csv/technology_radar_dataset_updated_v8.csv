After the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, only 100 out of 500 rainfall stations have remained operational, hampering its spatial hydrological data collection. The project employs Big Data and Machine Learning, to fill in the missing gap by turning CCTV footage and videos obtained by smartphones into a real-time rainfall observation, allowing for accurately geo-referenced and cost-effective data collection. All the information collected is then available on the web portal and enable the authorities to be better prepared for meteorologically and hydrologically based hazards and associated risks for the population and to lead to a better-informed policymaking.","Environment, Agriculture",Situational awareness/actionable information gathering,prototype,recovery,"Data Collection, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Cloud Computing",Climate Change,Europe,Southern Europe,Bosnia and Herzegovina ,"Aqua Procon s.r.o., H2I Balkans D.O.O.

By using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to analyze images provided by satellites, WFP can respond to emergencies without the delays and logistics obstacles associated with a traditional response.

38,PRISM,"When natural disasters strike, rescue services need to know where people are most at risk. The last population census in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was carried out in 2002, leaving a major gap in population data. This gap can create serious problems during emergencies.
