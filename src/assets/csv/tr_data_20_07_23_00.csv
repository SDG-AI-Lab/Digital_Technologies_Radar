However, the disadvantage of cameras is that they struggle to detect people who are hidden in shadows. To solve this problem, we mounted an array microphone on a UAV and to detect the human voice as a means of finding people that cameras cannot. Also a search method is proposed that combines voice and camera human detection to compensate for their respective shortcomings. The rate and accuracy of human detection by the proposed method are assessed experimentally.","Disaster Risk Management","Seach and rescue","prototype","response","Drones","Various","Global","Global","Global","None","None","Spatial Data","No Information","2020","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9104665","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/8948470/9104665/graphical_abstract/access-gagraphic-2998776.jpg","89","1d5841ec-0c18-4120-a9f0-e218fa8a5f57","2023-07-11T09:14:24.363184+00:00",""

"SKAI Platform","A lack of on-the-ground information at the start of a humanitarian crisis is a major obstacle to a quick, effective response. The WFP partnered with Google Research to set up the SKAI platform. Skai (formerly known as RUDA) uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and satellites to help WFP reduce the amount of time needed to understand the impact of disasters. By using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to analyze images provided by satellites, WFP can respond to emergencies without the delays and logistics obstacles associated with a traditional response. Skai dramatically speeds up the process of determining what has happened, what to expect on the ground, and help define the kind of support that is required.
